New Tab Notes
=========

What
======
This is a chrome extension that overrides the new tab page.

The layout is very simple, with bookmarks on the left, and on the right a big open space to write whatever you wish to keep infront of you as you browse the internet, saved in local storage.

Why
=======
There are a million new tab page extensions that all take either too long to load, are crowded with too much information, or that try to integrate with too many other services.

This is just a quick and minimalistic Google Docs like new tab page for you to jot down whatever notes you want to see every time you open a new page. For example, use it as a clipboard to save a few links, or use it as a todo list, or keep the current task you're working on in full view. The point is that there is no restriction with this new tab page like with most others, just make it to be whatever you want it to be.
